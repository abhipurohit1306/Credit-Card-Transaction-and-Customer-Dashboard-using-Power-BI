# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
Credit Card Transaction and Customer Dashboard using Power BI

1. Project Overview

    This project is an end-to-end Power BI dashboard created by following and implementing concepts from a YouTube tutorial. The project focuses on analyzing credit card financial data, including customer details and transaction behavior, to generate meaningful business insights.

    The objective of this project is to demonstrate practical skills in SQL, data modeling, DAX, and Power BI visualization, making it suitable for a Data Analyst / Power BI portfolio.

2. Business Problem

    Financial institutions need quick and clear insights into:

    Customer spending behavior

    Credit card usage patterns

    Revenue and transaction performance

    Weekly financial trends

    This project answers these questions by transforming raw data into interactive dashboards that support data‑driven decision making.

3. Data Sources

    The project uses multiple CSV files as data sources:

    credit_card.csv – Transaction‑level credit card data

    customer.csv – Customer demographic and profile data

    cust_add.csv – Customer address and location details

    cc_add.csv – Additional credit card attributes

    These datasets are combined and modeled inside Power BI.

4. Data Preparation & SQL

    A SQL script is used for data extraction and preprocessing:

    SQL Query - Financial Dashboard Data.sql

    SQL Tasks Performed:

    Joining customer and transaction tables

    Filtering unnecessary columns

    Preparing clean datasets for Power BI

    Improving performance before visualization

5. Data Modeling (Power BI)

    Established relationships between customer, credit card, and transaction tables

    Applied proper cardinality (one‑to‑many)

    Ensured optimized filtering and cross‑filter directions

    This data model forms the foundation for accurate reporting and KPIs.

6. DAX Measures & KPIs

    Key measures were created using DAX, including:

    Total Revenue

    Total Transactions

    Average Transaction Value

    Customer Count

    Weekly Revenue

    These KPIs help evaluate financial and customer performance.

7. Dashboards Created
    7.1 Customer Dashboard

        Customer segmentation by age, income, and location

        High‑value customer identification

        Card usage by customer group

    7.2 Transaction Dashboard

        Total transactions and revenue

        Spending distribution by card type and category

    7.3 Weekly Financial Dashboard

        Week‑on‑week revenue analysis

        Transaction trend monitoring

        Business performance tracking

        PDF exports of these dashboards are included in the project.
